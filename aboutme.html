            <p class="text-white text-base font-normal leading-normal pb-3 pt-1 px-4">
              Hello! I'm Franco Brignone. I was born on April 6, 2005, in Argentina. The name I use publicly is a pseudonym. It was inspired by one of the main characters in <i>Plata quemada</i> (Burnt Money), a 1997 Argentine novel that made a lasting impression on me. The story was later adapted into a film in the year 2000, which further deepened my appreciation for it, despite the fact that it was not a one-to-one adaptation.<br><br>
              During my early years, I spent a significant amount of time watching content on YouTube. This was a period when digital technology was beginning to make major strides, gradually becoming more accessible and widespread. However, in those earlier days of the platform, not everyone had the same opportunities to create or consume content in their languages, especially in Latin America. The rapid evolution of technology brought new possibilities, but access remained uneven across different regions.<br><br>
              As a native speaker of Latin American Spanish, I experienced firsthand how delayed access to modern technology affected content availability. For a time, creators from countries like Spain dominated the Spanish-speaking space on YouTube simply because they had earlier and easier access to the tools and internet speeds required to produce high-quality videos. As a result, I grew up primarily watching YouTubers from Spain. Over time, creators from Latin American countries—including Mexico, Chile, and eventually Argentina—began to find their voice on the platform, contributing their perspectives and content.<br><br>
              I still remember how it felt to learn the nuances of different dialects within the Spanish-speaking world. For example, Chilean Spanish includes many unique expressions and idioms, much like Argentine Spanish. So, if you were to ask me about a specific Chilean slang, there's a good chance I'd at least have an idea of what it means, thanks to the hours I spent watching Chilean content creators. That early exposure played a formative role in how I perceive and engage with language today.<br><br>
              Due to the limited availability of content in Latin American Spanish—particularly in more niche areas of interest—I found myself increasingly drawn to English-speaking creators. At first, watching videos in that language was a necessity rather than a preference, but it ultimately became one of the most influential factors in my language development. Through repeated exposure to spoken and written English, I began to understand the language more deeply. With time, practice, and curiosity—and with the cognitive flexibility that comes naturally to kids—I reached a level of fluency I'm truly proud of. Without this unconventional learning process, I doubt I would have achieved the same results through formal education alone. If I had grown up more recently, during a time when there is now an abundance of content from Latin American creators on YouTube, I probably never would have needed to watch videos in English.<br><br>
              On the creative side, I have developed proficiency in Adobe Photoshop, one of the most widely used software programs for digital image editing and design. I'm sure you've heard of it. I'm also skilled with Photopea, a free online alternative that closely replicates Photoshop's interface and functions. I use these tools for a wide range of purposes—both professionally and personally.<br><br>
              While I engage with a wide range of entertainment in my free time—like films, video games, and pro wrestling—there's one hobby I consistently return to: photography. I practice it informally, using only my phone, without specialized gear or any professional setup.<br><br>
              As you've probably gathered, my native language is Spanish, and I speak English fluently. Additionally, I have developed a modest understanding of Portuguese, Italian, and Basque. This multilingual interest stems from a personal curiosity about cultures and languages, and I've pursued it independently through a combination of casual study, media consumption, and self-guided exploration.
